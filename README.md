In order to know how to setup the project refer this [link](https://learnopengl.com/Getting-started/Creating-a-window).

## Things to be noted -
This repository doesn't deal with setup of the project. It contains the code files which illustrate various concepts learned in the site.
The user is supposed to setup an initial project in their preferred **IDE** or **environment** before pulling this repository. Also the glad.c file and stb_image.h are predefined libraries and can be used as it is or can be downloaded from sources mentioned in the above link.
